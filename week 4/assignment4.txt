Answer 1

Often times in our program we may want want to repeat things over and over again. To make this repetition
easier we have the concept of looping in computer science. This helps us avoid writing the same piece of code
again and again.
    - There are 2 types of looping statements in python namely for and while.
    - While loop is better suited for sentinel based repetition where it is not known in advance how many times
      the loop will be executed
    - For loop is better suited for counter-controlled repetition where number of repetitions is known beforehand
    - Loops can be nested just like if-else branch
    - Iteration is each repetition in a loop
    - break statement exits the immediate loop in which the break statement was located
    - continue statement ignores all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the
      control back to the start of the loop
