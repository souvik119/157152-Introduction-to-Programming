Answer 1

Value - Piece of infomation that cannot be further reduced. Example number 1, word hello
Expression - When something can be reduced. Example number 1 plus number 2 is number 3 so this is an arithmetic expression
Variable - An identified to refer to a value which could change over time. Usually variable refers to a specific type of value : number, text or anything else
Constant - Identifier for a vlue that will not change throught the program. Example constant pi can be assigned 3.14 value which will remain the same.
Operator - A symbol that represents action that can take place on value or values. It can also work on variables since those contain values. Example +, -
Compiler - A program that converts instructions into a machine-code or lower-level form so that they can be read and executed by a computer.
Interpreter - An interpreter is a computer program that is used to directly execute program instructions written using one of the many high-level programming languages.
Operating system - The software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as scheduling tasks, executing applications, and controlling peripherals.
String -  Most languages have a data type called a string, which is used for data values that are made up of ordered sequences of characters, such as "hello world".
Boolean - Boolean data type is a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false) which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra.


Answer 2

Installed editor: Notepad++
Things I like about Notepad++:
- Free and easy installation for Windows
- Syntax highlighting for Python
- Love the dark mode
- Allows Python code execution directly in the editor, without having to switch to another command prompt


Answer 3

Code:
# Python program to swap two variables

x = 2
y = 3

print('Value of x before swapping:', x)
print('Value of y before swapping:', y)

# create a temporary variable and swap the values
temp = x
x = y
y = temp

print('Value of x after swapping:', x)
print('Value of y after swapping:', y)


Explanation - This program swaps 2 variables x and y with each others values. In the example before swapping x and y had values of 2 and 3 respectively but after swapping the values are 3 and 2 respectively for x and y.
This was one of the examples provided in the lecture 2. Found the code at https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/swap-variables and modified a bit to better undserstand it.


Code execution:
C:\Users\sghosh\Documents\ucsd_python>python swap.py
Value of x before swapping: 2
Value of y before swapping: 3
Value of x after swapping: 3
Value of y after swapping: 2
