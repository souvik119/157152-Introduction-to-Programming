Answer 1
Hello world in C#
namespace HelloWorld

{

     class Hello {

                                   static void Main(string[] args)

                                    { System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

                                      }

                          } 

}

This language seems a lot similar to Hello World program in Java, in the sense that visually the construct seems very similar. Also in terms of length c and python seem to do the same thing with less lines of code.
In my opinion, C# uses a lot of lines of code to just print a line "Hello World" which I dislike.
 

Answer 2

C language : Extremely fast processing makes this the best language for time critical operations. Suits the need when we need to control the hardware.
Java language :   Most programs can run on any device that can run Java. Great for large coding teams. Also syntax wise it is more forgiving than C.
Python language : Easy to read, write and understand. Extremely suitable for beginners as it is much easier to start programming.
