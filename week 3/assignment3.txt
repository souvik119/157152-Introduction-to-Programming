Answer 1

Most basic flow of a program is where a number of statements are executed top to bottom in a linear fashion, for example, display a sum of 2 numbers.
However in real life we often come accross many situations where there could be multiple paths from start to end point. This is where branching 
comes in to control the flow of program, for example, in a calculator the operation being performed determines the end result and there could be different results
depending on the operation.
In short it means taking decisions based on the evaluation of a condition.

Following concepts help in decision making:
- Relational operators : > < >= <= == !=
- Logical operators : and or not
- Flow control statements : if else elif
